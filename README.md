## 📘 Internship Progress

### 🔹 Week 1 (Days 1–7) — Foundations
- **Day 1 – Environment Setup & GitHub** → Installed Python, Jupyter/Colab, Git, and n8n. Practiced GitHub workflows.  
- **Day 2 – Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** → Worked with Titanic & Heart datasets. Feature engineering, normalization.  
- **Day 3 – Model Training & Evaluation** → Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Random Forest performed best.  
- **Day 4 – Workflow Automation (n8n)** → Google Sheets automation + AI summarization APIs.  
- **Day 5 – Supabase Integration** → CRUD operations, Row-Level Security (RLS).  
- **Day 6 – AI Agents & Prompt Engineering** → Built a simple RAG demo with external knowledge.  
- **Day 7 – Mini Project** → Bank Loan pipeline → preprocessing → Random Forest → Supabase metrics → daily n8n automation.  

✅ **Outcome**: Built strong foundations in ML, Supabase backend, and workflow automation.

### 🔹 Week 2 (Days 8–14) — Applied Projects
- **Day 8 – GitHub Collaboration** → Created repo `itech-learning-salma`, structured Week1, practiced branching.  
- **Day 9 – WhatsApp Simulation** → Simulated messaging via Evolution API, logged chats in Supabase.  
- **Day 10 – Flower Bloom Order & FAQ Workflow** → Automated orders via Google Forms, integrated FAQ AI, stored orders in Supabase.  
- **Day 11 – Telegram AI Assistant with Memory** → Built Telegram bot with persistent memory using Supabase.  
- **Day 12–13 – FAQ Bot with Supabase** → Hybrid FAQ bot (Python embeddings + n8n keyword search). Logged conversations + daily summaries to Google Sheets.  
- **Day 14 – Demo & Report** → Recorded Loom demo, prepared report analyzing business extensions.  

✅ **Outcome**: Applied Week1 foundations into real-world scenarios — chatbots, order management, multi-channel assistants.

### 🔹 Week 3 (Days 15–21) — Advanced Workflows & Error Handling
- **Day 15 – GitHub Collaboration & Pull Requests** → Forked an open-source n8n/Supabase repo, created a feature branch, opened a Pull Request, and documented PR steps.  
- **Day 16 – Supabase Schema Design (Leads & Conversations)** → Designed schema for `leads` and `conversations` tables with RLS enabled. Deliverable: SQL schema + screenshots.  
- **Day 17 – WhatsApp AI Assistant (Lite Version)** → Built sandbox WhatsApp AI Assistant using Evolution API simulation. Logged messages & AI responses into Supabase.  
- **Day 18 – Sales Data Engine (Prototype)** → Created workflow to process uploaded PDF/Excel files, extract structured sales data, and store in Supabase.  
- **Day 19 – Performance & Cost Optimization** → Researched token usage reduction strategies. Implemented batching/caching in WhatsApp Assistant Lite.  
- **Day 20 – Monitoring & Error Handling** → Added error handling in n8n, logged errors into `error_logs` table, and sent error notifications to Google Sheets/email.  
- **Day 21 – Weekly Demo & Report** → Recorded Loom demo (5–7 mins) showing WhatsApp Lite Assistant, Sales Data Engine, error handling & optimization. Wrote 2–3 page report *“From Sandbox to Production – How iTech AI Workflows Can Scale.”*  

✅ **Outcome**: Delivered sandbox AI assistant, sales data engine prototype, schema design, optimization, and robust error handling — all tied together with GitHub collaboration and documentation.
